# NpxCard: mariocsan

## Description

Welcome to the repository for `mariocsan`! ðŸš€

This repository houses the source code for a unique NPX card that provides a quick and command-line accessible introduction to the owner of this repository. 
The NPX card is a creative way to share information about the individual, including their name, role, and links to social media or notable projects.

## NPX Card
Before using it, make sure you have node installed. You can check this running:
```bash
  npm -v
```
If the command doesn't return the version of npm, you must [install node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current) to use it.

To view the NPX card, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx mariocsan
```
